We have seen how to assign values to variables, and have explored the functionalities of basic data types (`int`, `float`, `bool` and `None`). Moreover, we have discussed the use of different operators for arithmetic calculations (e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`). If any of these contents feel unfamiliar to you, please re-visit the first tutorial. Many of the contents below will build upon these foundations.\n",
