However, we have not paid too much attention to how we store the inputs or outputs of our code. This can make a big difference, especially for more complex software – smart decisions about structuring the data are almost as important as smart decisions about the code logics.\n",

In this chapter, we will first re-visit the `list` and its functionalities. Afterwards, we will learn about further compound data types, namely the `tuple`, `dict` and `set` data types."
